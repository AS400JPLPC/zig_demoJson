**ZIG-LANG  essai JSON ** <BR />
  


Good morning,<BR />
I needed to make a program and work with JSON.<BR />
<BR />
I was inspired by this code, it was good.<BR />

<BR /> 
Since there aren't many examples, that does the job from start to finish.<BR />
<BR />
This demonstration applies to the possibility of saving and reading JSON.<BR />
To put in a structure and see how to make a JSON<BR />
<BR />
I kept it simple, it's not a work of abstraction, but something that can be incorporated into a module incorporating into a model.<BR />
<BR />
Thanks to everyone who helped me.<BR />
